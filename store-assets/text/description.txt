You just spent 20 minutes on regex101 writing a pattern. You switch back to your editor. You forget the flags. You go back. You copy-paste. You lose your test string.

Sound familiar?

Regex Tester Pro by Zovo lives in your browser toolbar. Click once, write your pattern, see matches instantly. No new tabs. No copy-pasting. No context switching. Just regex that works.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT

Most regex tools are websites. You leave your code, open a tab, lose your flow, and copy results back manually. Regex Tester Pro is a popup extension — it opens in 100ms, runs entirely offline, and keeps everything local. Your patterns, your history, your settings. Nothing ever leaves your browser.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WRITE REGEX FASTER

Type a pattern and watch matches light up in real-time. No submit buttons. No refreshing. Just instant feedback as you type. Color-coded matches, numbered results, and capture groups extracted automatically.

Don't know the right syntax? Click the ⚡ Quick Insert palette to drop in common tokens, anchors, quantifiers, and lookaround blocks directly into your pattern. Or just open the built-in cheat sheet for a full reference.

Still stuck? Describe what you want in plain English — the AI generator will write the regex for you. "Match all email addresses" becomes a working pattern in seconds.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

UNDERSTAND ANY PATTERN

Inherited a 200-character regex from a coworker? The Pattern Explainer breaks it down token by token in plain English. Each piece of the pattern gets its own description so you know exactly what it does before you touch it.

The 40+ examples library has ready-made patterns for the things developers need constantly — email validation, URLs, IP addresses, phone numbers, dates, passwords, HTML tags, hex colors, and more. Click any example to load it instantly.

SHIP WITH CONFIDENCE

✦ The ReDoS Safety Analyzer scans your pattern for dangerous backtracking before you ship it. Nested quantifiers, overlapping alternation, catastrophic complexity — it catches the patterns that crash production servers. A small badge shows 🟢 Safe, 🟡 Caution, or 🔴 Dangerous right next to your match count.

✦ Multi-String Testing lets you validate against multiple inputs at once. Paste a list of test cases (one per line) and see which ones pass and which ones fail. Perfect for checking form validation against edge cases.

✦ Code Export generates copy-ready snippets in JavaScript, Python, Java, PHP, Go, Ruby, C#, and Rust. The right API, the right flag translation, ready to paste into your project.
