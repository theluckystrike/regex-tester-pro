This extension does not use remote code.

All JavaScript code is bundled within the extension package and reviewed during Chrome Web Store submission. The extension does not:
• Load external scripts
• Use eval() or dynamic code execution
• Fetch code from external servers
• Execute any remotely-hosted JavaScript

The only external network request the extension makes is to the Zovo license verification API (https://zovo.one) for Pro license validation. This request contains only the license key and extension ID — no user data.
