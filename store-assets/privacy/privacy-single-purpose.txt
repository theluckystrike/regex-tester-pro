Regex Tester Pro serves a single purpose: testing and debugging regular expressions directly in your browser toolbar.

Specifically, this extension:
• Provides a real-time regex testing environment with match highlighting
• Saves regex pattern history locally for quick recall
• Does NOT collect, transmit, or process any user data externally

All processing happens locally in your browser. No data is collected, transmitted, or stored on external servers. Your regex patterns and test strings never leave your device.

The extension requires 4 permissions to function:
• Storage: Used to save your settings, pattern history, and preferences locally
• ActiveTab: Used to enable the context menu feature on the current page when you right-click
• ContextMenus: Used to add "Test regex on selection" to your right-click menu
• Alarms: Used to schedule daily license status refresh for Pro users
