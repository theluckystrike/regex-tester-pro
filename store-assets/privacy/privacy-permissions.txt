STORAGE

Justification:
This permission is required to save user preferences, pattern history, and application state locally on the device.

Specifically, Regex Tester Pro uses this permission to:
1. Store saved regex patterns and their test strings for quick recall
2. Persist user settings (theme preference, default flags, auto-save toggle)
3. Track daily AI generation usage count (resets daily, local only)

What we DO with this permission:
• Save and retrieve user settings and pattern history
• Cache license validation status to minimize API calls

What we DO NOT do:
• Store any personally identifiable information
• Sync data to external servers
• Share stored data with third parties

User control:
• Users can clear all data through Chrome extension settings
• Users can use the "Clear All" button in the history panel
• All data is deleted automatically on extension uninstall

ACTIVETAB

Justification:
This permission is required to enable the right-click context menu feature that lets users test regex on selected text from any webpage.

Specifically, Regex Tester Pro uses this permission to:
1. Read the text selection when user right-clicks and selects "Test regex on selection"
2. Pass the selected text to the popup for regex testing

What we DO with this permission:
• Read selected text only when user explicitly triggers the context menu

What we DO NOT do:
• Access page content in the background
• Read or modify any webpage without user action
• Monitor browsing activity

User control:
• The feature only activates when user explicitly right-clicks and selects the menu item

---

CONTEXTMENUS

Justification:
This permission is required to add a "Test regex on selection" option to the right-click context menu.

Specifically, Regex Tester Pro uses this permission to:
1. Create a single context menu entry for quick regex testing
2. Enable workflow where users select text on a page and test it against patterns

What we DO with this permission:
• Add one right-click menu option that appears when text is selected

What we DO NOT do:
• Add excessive menu items
• Modify existing browser menu options

User control:
• Users can disable the extension to remove the context menu entry

ALARMS

Justification:
This permission is required to schedule a daily license validation check for Pro users.

Specifically, Regex Tester Pro uses this permission to:
1. Refresh Pro license status every 24 hours
2. Reset the daily AI generation counter at midnight

What we DO with this permission:
• Schedule two daily alarms (license refresh and AI quota reset)

What we DO NOT do:
• Send notifications or alerts to the user
• Run frequent background processes
• Track user activity

User control:
• Alarms only perform internal housekeeping — no user-visible effects
