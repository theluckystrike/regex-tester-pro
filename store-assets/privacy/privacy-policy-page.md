# Privacy Policy - Regex Tester Pro

*Last updated: February 2026*

## Overview

Regex Tester Pro is a Chrome extension developed by Zovo that provides real-time regular expression testing, debugging, and generation directly in your browser toolbar. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

**TL;DR: We don't collect any of your data. Everything stays on your device.**

## Data Collection

Regex Tester Pro does **not** collect any personal data.

We do not collect:
- Your name, email, or contact information
- Your browsing history or activity
- Your regex patterns or test strings
- Analytics, usage statistics, or telemetry
- Any data that could identify you

## Local Storage

The extension stores the following data **locally on your device only**:

| Data | Purpose | Location |
|------|---------|----------|
| Theme preference | Display settings | chrome.storage.local |
| Default flags | User preferences | chrome.storage.local |
| Pattern history | Quick pattern recall | chrome.storage.local |
| AI usage counter | Daily limit tracking | chrome.storage.local |
| License key | Pro tier validation | chrome.storage.local |

This data:
- Never leaves your device (except license key for validation)
- Is not synced to any server
- Can be cleared through Chrome's extension settings
- Is deleted when you uninstall the extension

## Data Transmission

The extension makes one optional network request:
- **License verification**: If you enter a Pro license key, it is sent to `zovo.one` to verify validity. Only the key and extension ID are transmitted. No user data, patterns, or browsing information is included.

All regex processing happens locally in your browser.

## Third-Party Services

This extension does not integrate with or send data to any third-party services other than the Zovo license API for Pro users.

## Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions:

| Permission | Why It's Needed |
|------------|-----------------|
| Storage | Saves settings and pattern history locally |
| ActiveTab | Enables right-click "Test regex on selection" feature |
| ContextMenus | Adds menu option for quick regex testing on selected text |
| Alarms | Schedules daily license refresh and AI quota reset |

## Children's Privacy

This extension does not knowingly collect any data from users of any age, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We will update this policy if our practices change. The "Last updated" date at the top indicates when this policy was last revised.
